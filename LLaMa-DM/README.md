# Overview

The heart of this project is to create a game utlizing a LLM (Large Language Model) to provide an organic-feeling story element.

This game utilizes ollama (Meta AI's local LLM) to provide a descriptive storytelling element to gameplay. The current version of the game is centered around turn-based combat, with a single interaction button to advance turns so that player may read the current turn's description before moving on to the next turn.

The purpose of this project was to use ai to create a game that had a unique story every time.
